Brent's Feedback on Results from Main.py (preliminary bounding box)
1. The bounding box looks great.
2. Keep the green overlay in the image display as it shows the region we want.
3. Now run through all image sets (I am currently working on the iteration code - have to separate iris and cornea images into separate folders, input the two images of one set into each iteration).
4. Report a percentage of which sets work vs which did not have an overlap and did not work.
5. Report when we expect to fix this so that it works 100%.
6. Brent is going to talk to Ben.
7. Ben will look at our results, see if they are good.
8. Ask Ben to give us another oct dataset or annotated scleral spurs which we can put in SimpleMind.
9. Ask Wasil if SimpleMind still just uses traditional image analysis tools at this moment or 
whether we can incorporate it's Cognitive Ai at this point to give some results for images that do not have prior annotations.

otherwise good work on the code Seena! I am going to run it through all images. 
It appears that for those where there is not an overlap, there will not be a bounding box (is this correct?)
Good luck on your project and midterm.
